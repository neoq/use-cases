## Introduction

Wind energy domain, even though largely seen as an engineering domain, is characterized as  multi-disciplinary, thus relaying on the following domains with an aim of providing practical solutions that will result in cost-effective electricity from the wind:
- Earth Sciences, especially atmospheric science
- Mechanical Engineering
- Material Science
- Electrical Engineering
- Computer Science
- Social Science

[DTU Wind Energy](https://www.vindenergi.dtu.dk/english) is one of the world most recognized wind energy related institutes. DTU Wind Energy operates [a number of research and commercial facilities](https://www.vindenergi.dtu.dk/english/test-centers/research-facilities) (some permanent, some mobile) which consists of a large pull of instruments. Certain instruments are off-the-shelf-products, while others DTU Wind Energy either develops or modifies to suit particular needs.

Generally speaking, wind energy domain immensely cares about the metrological aspects of its instruments since uncertainties of measurands directly translate to for example finances (e.g., the uncertainty of 0.1 m/s in the measured wind speed leads to an estimated saving/loss worth around 10 MÂ£ per year for the 25 year lifetime of a wind farm project) or safety ([failure of wind turbines can be dangerous to people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwS-FH38Fqg)) .

## Internal instrumentation database

[DTU Wind Energy](https://www.vindenergi.dtu.dk/english) operates an instrumentation database [instruments.windenergy.dtu.dk](instruments.windenergy.dtu.dk), which is accessible only for selected DTU staff.
